# Employee_Churn_Prediction
Welcome to the realm of employee churn prediction, where the power ofÂ machine learning meets data-driven insights! 
Retaining great personnel is a major challenge for firms in the fast-paced commercial world of today.
The expense and disruption of employee turnover can have an impact on output, morale, and ultimately, the bottom line.
In order to accurately forecast and reduce staff churn, we have taken advantage of the capabilities of Logistic Regression (LR), a potent machine learning model.
We will examine how Logistic Regression uses historical data and numerous employee-related criteria to forecast the possibility that an employee would leave the company in this introduction.
We'll examine the workings of LR, its advantages and disadvantages, and the crucial procedures required in creating a reliable staff churn prediction model.
